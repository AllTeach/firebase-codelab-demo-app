# Firestore — Write and Read Data (Keep It Simple)

Goal
- Learn Cloud Firestore in a simple and clear way.
- Explain the move from SQL to NoSQL (document database).
- Show how a Java POJO maps to a Firestore document.
- Emphasize writing data (set) and reading data (get) and why operations are asynchronous (use callbacks).
- Do NOT include createdAt in main examples — timestamps and realtime listeners are optional bonus topics.

Audience
- Students who know SQL basics (tables, rows, joins) and are starting with Firestore.
